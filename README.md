# IEEE_Arduino_Workshop
This repository contains all the Arduino code, examples, and resources for the IEEE Temple University Chapter Breadboard Workshop.  Whether you’re a beginner or have some experience with Arduino, you’ll find everything you need to follow along during the workshop.


Objective: 
1. Introduce students to electronic prototyping​

Learn how to use a breadboard, resistors, LEDs, and jumper wires.​

2. Introduce Arduino Nano​

Understand how to upload code, control digital outputs, and interface with hardware
components​

3. Demonstrate electrical concepts​

Calculate Ohm’s Law, voltage dividers, and how changes in resistance affect LED brightness.​

4. Provide hands-on experience with circuit building and debugging​

Encourage participants to assemble and test their own working circuits, reinforcing learning
by doing.​
